# Sample .NET Core With DI and Repository Pattern

Hello,

I used .Net Core WebApp for this project with Three Layer Architecture. For execution of this projects follow the instruction below:

1. Please Download the database I provided for this solution from the link below :

      DATABASE : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GkYzZWq13CdYFb6RSLg9MlV_a9uEdZDu/view?usp=sharing
      
      * The Database contains the sample data you gave with a stored procedure.
      
2. Restore database in your local pc. Because I refer local in the connection. If you want to restore it on a server please change the connection string too.
3. Download the project In this github
4. Run the project.
5. Click on Search menu on top of the page
6. Enter data for the whole form
7. Click Search button

The results will be shown in a datatable for show purposes. But we can deliver results in JSON or something else. If you want to see maximum data that stored in database (168K) the query itself manage to answer the request in a less than 2 seconds.
